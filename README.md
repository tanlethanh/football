# Football

A mini football game written in C++ with SDL 2 framework

## Setup

First, you need to install frameworks and place it into `frameworks` directory (or any place with changing path config)

Require: SDL2, SDL2_image

## Note

The configuration currently supports for MacOS only

I use [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) for the architectural style of this game
